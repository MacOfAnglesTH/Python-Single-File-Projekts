# Generating XML Files with Python
🐍 This Python script generates the following XML files:
- AnlageKonfiguration.xml
- BasisKonfiguration.xml
- InstallationsKonfiguration.xml
- LabKonfiguration.xml

These files are used as startup configuration settings for a test program.

I added a comment function because some element comments are needed as helpers for debugging purposes.

This is an initial prototype of the program.

The final version will read additional input from system commands and external files.

##### the code is for python till version 3.6.8 !!!
##### #python, #xml
##### 🔒 To maintain the confidentiality, some inputs and variable names in these scripts have been modified or anonymized.
