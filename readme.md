# Python Lite-Deploy Tools (3.6.8)
## This repository features a collection of single-file Python scripts designed for lightweight deployment and seamless integration into larger projects.

🚀 Design Philosophy
Single-File Architecture: Every project is contained within one .py file for maximum portability.

Minimal Dependencies: Focus on the Python Standard Library to ensure scripts run anywhere without complex environment setups.

Easy Integration: Designed to be dropped into larger codebases with zero friction.
